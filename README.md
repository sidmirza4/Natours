# Natours
Welcome Guys! This repo consists of my code for Natours Project, which I made as a part of my course, Node.js, Express, MongoDB & More: The Complete Bootcamp. The project consists of 2 different parts:
- A Server-Side API, based on technologies, such as Node, Express & MongoDB. It is published on <a target='_blank' href='https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10118730/TVYDdeFM'>Postman</a>.
- A Client-Side rendered website, based on technologies such as HTML, CSS, JS, Pug, which consumes the API. It is hosted on <a target='_blank' href='https://natours4.herokuapp.com'>Heroku</a>. 

# Features  
- A project (API + Website) based on MEN stack.
