==> You are allowed to use Natours API for you own front-end, but there is no proper documentation available for the API yet. So if you want to use the api contact me at my email <a href="mailto:sidmirza4@gmail.com">here</a>. Or you can open an issue for that as well.  
P.S: You feedback is important, please take a look and let me know what do you think.
